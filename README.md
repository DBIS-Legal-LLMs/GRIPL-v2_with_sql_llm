# GRIPL - GDPR Risk Identification in Processes using Large Language Models

Identifying GDPR-Critical Tasks in Business Processes using Large Language Models

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and research artifacts for the GRIPL framework. The system consists of a frontend, a backend, a RAG service, a PostgreSQL database, and a Neo4j database.

The RAG service provides a Retrieval-Augmented Generation API that queries a LightRAG knowledge graph built from GDPR-related legal documents and returns relevant legal context to the backend during analysis.

In addition to the code, the repository includes:
- A labeled dataset of BPMN files in `dataset/` for reproducing the evaluation
- Experiment configurations and results in `experiments/`
- A system demo in `system demo/`

The datasets are provided as CSV exports of the database and can be imported to run the application with the same data used in the experiments.

## Docker Setup

> NOTE: The Production hosting is still under development, for local setup refer to [Run Locally](#1-run-locally)

This project can be run in different environments by **composing multiple docker-compose files**.

This project provides:

* `docker-compose.yml` – base services (frontend, backend, RAG service, Postgres, Neo4j)
* `docker-compose.local.yml` – local testing and running
* `docker-compose.prod.yml` – production style, with Traefik labels and watchtower labels, expects an existing **external** Traefik network (default: `web`)
* `docker-compose.traefik.yml` – optional Traefik container, in case the host does **not** already run Traefik
* `docker-compose.watchtower.yml` – optional Watchtower container

Environment specific values (like hosts, Traefik network name, email, ports) are provided via `.env` files.

Attention: If you are using **Windows**, make sure to adjust the following:
- Under Settins > General enable: Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS
- Under Settings > Docker Engine add: "min-api-version": "1.24"

Attention: If you are using **Linux**:
- Change the docker-compose.traefik to use
  ```bash
  command:
    - --providers.docker=true
    - --providers.docker.endpoint=unix://var/run/docker.sock
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
  ```

### 1. Run locally

The local setup is described in the `docker-compose.local.yml`

First you need to build the docker image:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml build
```

Then you can start the system

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up
```

You will then have three docker containers running:

* frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* backend (swagger): [http://localhost:8000/swagger-ui](http://localhost:8000/swagger-ui)
* Postgres: localhost:5432
* RAG service: [http://localhost/rag](http://localhost/rag)


### 2. Run in production (server already has Traefik + Watchtower)

```bash
cp .env.prod.example .env.prod
# make sure the external Docker network exists:
# docker network create web
docker compose --env-file .env.prod -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

This will:

* attach all services to your existing `web` network,
* expose the frontend on `${GRIPL_HOST}` and `www.${GRIPL_HOST}`,
* expose the backend on `${GRIPL_HOST}/api`,
* and enable Watchtower updates for all of them.

---

### 3. Run Watchtower and Traefik alongside (server does not have them yet)

If your host does **not** run Watchtower and Traefik yet, add:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.prod \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.prod.yml \
  -f docker-compose.traefik.yml \
  -f docker-compose.watchtower.yml up -d
```

Watchtower is configured to only update containers that have the label
`com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true`, which we add in `docker-compose.prod.yml`.

## Run locally without Docker for development

See [gripl/gripl-backend/README.md](gripl/gripl-backend/README.md) for instructions on running the backend locally.

See [gripl/gripl-frontend/README.md](gripl/gripl-frontend/README.md) for instructions on running the frontend locally.

See [gripl/gripl-sql-llm/README.md](gripl/gripl-sql-llm/README.md) for prerequisites before using this service.

The RAG service can be run locally by installing the dependencies from `gripl/gripl-rag/requirements.txt` and starting it with `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8081` from the `gripl/gripl-rag` directory. It requires a running Neo4j instance, which can be started with Docker (see `docker-compose.yml`). This is the same requirements file used by the Docker image. Note that on Linux, the system libraries `libgl1` and `libglib2.0-0` are additionally required by PyMuPDF / LightRAG (the Docker image installs them automatically; on Windows they are bundled with the pip wheels).

Local development requires a running PostgreSQL database. The simplest option is to start a fresh instance with Docker and set the backend’s database connection via environment variables. On startup, the backend will automatically create any missing tables.

Alternatively, you can use `docker-compose.local.yaml` to bring up the entire stack (frontend, backend, PostgreSQL) with Docker as explained above and point your locally running frontend and backend to that database as well.

## Tool Components
The GRIPL tool consists of three main components:

**1. The Sandbox**

Here, users can model or import processes and let the LLM analyze the process model.

The model also creates a reasoning for the activity classification.

**2. The Labeling Editor**
   
Here, users can create and label their own BPMN 2.0 dataset. A reasoning can also be added to the labels.

**3. The evaluation plattform**
   
Evaluations can be configured via the GUI or a YAML file.

The results are represented by model
